## Testing Methodology
- Document all test results in this single file
- Only mention tests that fail (passing tests are assumed successful)
- Include screenshots when relevant
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next task
- Use checkbox format `[]` for easy marking with `x`
- Keep brackets together with no space between them
- This allows quick marking by just inserting `x` without deleting spaces
- Example: `[]` becomes `[x]` with a single character insertion
