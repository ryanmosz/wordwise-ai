# OpenAI API Key Configuration Status

## IMPORTANT: OpenAI API Key Already Configured

The OpenAI API key has been successfully configured in the Supabase project dashboard as a secret.

### Configuration Details:
- **Status**: âœ… CONFIGURED
- **Location**: Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > Secrets
- **Secret Name**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Project Reference**: `gcvqhujqaofvelcxczfm`

### For AI Assistants:
When working on task 6.6 (Configure OpenAI API key), you should:
1. **SKIP** the actual API key configuration - it's already done
2. **SKIP** setting up the secret in Supabase - it's already set
3. **PROCEED** directly to task 6.6.1 (running test-edge-function-prompts.sh)
4. The edge function is already deployed and working at: `https://gcvqhujqaofvelcxczfm.supabase.co/functions/v1/analyze-text`

### Test Command:
To verify the edge function is working, you can run:
```bash
./scripts/test-edge-function-prompts.sh
```

This will test the deployed edge function with various prompts and show the AI suggestions.

### Note:
The edge function expects the OpenAI API key to be available as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which is already configured in the Supabase project.
