# Inline Suggestions - Comprehensive Edge Case Testing

## Latest Changes (v20)

### Comprehensive Edge Case Support
Added extensive edge case testing to Test 8 to ensure the suggestion marking system handles all scenarios correctly:

1. **Partial Word Underlining**
   - Only "are" underlined in "This are grammatical errors."

2. **Multi-Word Partial Underlining**
   - "This are" - two words with space between them

3. **Skip First Word**
   - "are grammatical errors." - everything except "This"

4. **Skip Last Word**
   - "This are grammatical" - everything except "errors."

5. **Multi-Line Full Underline**
   - Complete long sentence that wraps across lines

6. **Multi-Line Partial Underline**
   - "very long sentence that will wrap" - partial marking in wrapped text

7. **Line Break Spanning**
   - "spans across where the line break occurs" - underline crosses line boundary

8. **Discontinuous Underlining**
   - "Front words are underlined" + "end words underlined." - middle words skipped

## Implementation Details

### Special Case Handling
The `applyMarkWithPunctuation` function now works with special cases:
- `partial-are` - Finds specific instance and marks only "are"
- `two-words` - Marks exactly two words with space
- `skip-first` - Starts marking after first word
- `skip-last` - Stops marking before last word
- `partial-multiline` - Partial marking in multi-line text
- `span-break` - Marking that spans line breaks
- `front-part` / `end-part` - Separate marks for discontinuous underlining

### Test Structure
Test 8 now includes:
- Lines 1-8: Original comprehensive test (all 8 suggestion types)
- Line 9: Partial word test ("are" only)
- Line 10: Two-word test ("This are")
- Line 11: Skip first word test
- Line 12: Skip last word test
- Line 13: Full multi-line sentence
- Line 14: Partial multi-line
- Line 15: Line-break spanning
- Line 16: Discontinuous underlining

## Verification Steps

1. Open http://localhost:3001/test-suggestion-mark
2. Click "Test 8: Multi-line Suggestions"
3. Check Debug Console for detailed results
4. Verify each edge case:
   - Line 9 shows only "are" underlined
   - Line 10 shows "This are" underlined
   - Line 11 shows "are grammatical errors." (no "This")
   - Line 12 shows "This are grammatical" (no "errors.")
   - Lines 13-15 test multi-line scenarios
   - Line 16 shows discontinuous underlining

## Key Features Validated

1. **Underline Rules Compliance**
   - Word boundaries respected
   - Punctuation included with words
   - No unwanted splits

2. **Flexible Marking**
   - Full sentences
   - Partial words
   - Multi-word phrases
   - Discontinuous text

3. **Visual Clarity**

   - Cyan readability vs blue persuasive
   - Consistent hover states

## Previous Issues Status
All previous issues remain fixed:
- ✅ Punctuation preservation
