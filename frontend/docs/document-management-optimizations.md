# Document Management Optimizations

## Performance Improvements

### 1. Limited Document Loading
- Only loads the 20 most recent documents instead of all documents
- Reduces initial load time and memory usage
- Prevents performance degradation as users accumulate documents

### 2. Empty Document Reuse
- When creating a "new" document, first checks for existing empty documents
- Reuses empty documents instead of creating duplicates
- Prevents accumulation of abandoned empty documents

### 3. Document Cleanup (Optional)
- Added `cleanupEmptyDocuments()` method
- Can be called periodically to remove duplicate empty documents
- Keeps only the most recent empty document

## Benefits
- **Faster Load Times**: Loading 20 documents vs 79+ is much faster
- **Less Database Storage**: Prevents accumulation of empty documents
- **Better Performance**: UI stays responsive even with heavy usage
- **Cleaner Data**: No duplicate empty "Untitled Document" entries

## Usage Patterns Handled
1. **Frequent Refreshing**: Reuses existing documents instead of creating new ones
2. **Long-term Usage**: Limits loaded documents to keep performance consistent
3. **Testing/Development**: Prevents test document accumulation

## Future Enhancements
1. Add pagination for accessing older documents
2. Implement document archiving
3. Add "Recently Edited" vs "All Documents" views
4. Automatic cleanup of very old empty documents

## Implementation Notes
- The 20 document limit is configurable
- Empty documents are identified by:
  - No content (`''`)
  - Default TipTap content (`'<p></p>'`)
- Most recent documents are always prioritized
