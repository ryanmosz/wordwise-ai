- [x] Bold button works

- [x] Underline button works (strikethrough) no, as underline
- [x] H1, H2, H3 buttons work
The H buttons work,H1 is the largest. H2 is middle-sized. H3 is the smallest. They're all bigger than regular Paragraph text.  
- [x] Paragraph button works
The paragraph button doesn't change the size of text because the H buttons don't work. But if I select a text has been denoted by H1, H2 or H3 and then I click the paragraph button, the H designation is removed and it's regular paragraph text. So this works.

- [x] Character count updates in footer
It updates. I count 70 character count shows 70. i am counting spaces as chars but not newlines
