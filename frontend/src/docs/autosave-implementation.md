# Auto-Save Implementation Summary

## Task 5.5: Implement auto-save functionality

### Implementation Details

1. **Created Debounce Utility** (`src/utils/debounce.ts`)
   - Custom debounce function with TypeScript generics
   - 2-second delay as specified
   - Includes cancel method for cleanup

2. **Updated Document Store** (`src/store/documentStore.ts`)
   - Added `updateDocumentDebounced` method
   - Added `cancelPendingSave` method for cleanup
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Maintains existing optimistic update pattern

3. **Updated Editor Page** (`src/pages/EditorPage.tsx`)
   - Connected `handleContentChange` to `updateDocumentDebounced`
   - Auto-save triggers on every content change
   - Properly debounced to prevent excessive API calls

### Key Features Implemented

- ✅ 2-second debounce after user stops typing
- ✅ Visual feedback: "Saving..." → "Saved" → "Error saving"
- ✅ Optimistic updates for immediate UI response
- ✅ Error handling with status reversion
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Memory leak prevention with cancel method

### How It Works

1. User types in the editor
2. `handleContentChange` is called with new content
3. `updateDocumentDebounced` is triggered
4. Previous pending saves are cancelled
5. After 2 seconds of no typing:
   - Status changes to "Saving..."
   - Document is saved to Supabase
   - Status changes to "Saved" or "Error saving"

### Testing Verification

The implementation can be verified by:
1. Typing in the editor and watching the save status
2. Checking browser console for auto-save logs
3. Refreshing the page to verify persistence
4. Testing error scenarios (offline mode)

### Architecture Notes

- Follows existing patterns in the codebase
- Uses Zustand for state management
- Integrates with Supabase for persistence
- Maintains TypeScript type safety throughout
