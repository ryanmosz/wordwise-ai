## Testing Strategy Review

### 1. Current Testing Summary
Please provide:
- What tests have you executed for this step?
- What were the specific outcomes/results?
- Any issues or failures encountered?

### 2. Testing Tool Utilization
Have you used the available automated testing features from:
- [ ] CLI testing commands (see `docs/automated-testing-guide.md`)
- [ ] W3M testing capabilities (see `docs/w3m-testing-guide.md`)

If not, which tools remain unused and why?

### 3. Testing Coverage Assessment
Based on the current step's changes:
- What aspects of the code were modified?
- Which of these modifications have been tested?
- Are there any untested areas that pose risks?

### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis
Provide your recommendation:

**Option A: Continue Testing**
- What specific additional tests would add value?
- What risks would these tests mitigate?
- Estimated time investment?

**Option B: Proceed to Next Step**
- Why is current test coverage sufficient?
- What makes additional testing have diminishing returns?
- Are there any acceptable risks we're taking?

### 5. Recommendation
State clearly: Should we perform additional testing now or move forward? Justify your answer considering:
- Current project stage
- Complexity of recent changes
- Available time vs. quality improvement
- The fact that we'll test again after the next step

Remember: We aim for appropriate testing, not exhaustive testing. Balance quality assurance with development momentum. We don't want to hit the point of diminishing returns.

If you believe further testing is necessary commence testing now.
