## Testing Strategy Review

### 1. Current Testing Summary
Please provide:
- What tests have you executed for this step?
- What were the specific outcomes/results?
- Any issues or failures encountered?

### 2. Testing Tool Utilization
Have you used the available automated testing features from:
- [ ] CLI testing commands (see `docs/automated-testing-guide.md`)
- [ ] W3M testing capabilities (see `docs/w3m-testing-guide.md`)

If not, which tools remain unused and why?

### 3. Testing Coverage Assessment
Based on the current step's changes:
- What aspects of the code were modified?
- Which of these modifications have been tested?
- Are there any untested areas that pose risks?

### 4. Cost-Benefit Analysis
Provide your recommendation:

**Option A: Continue Testing**
- What specific additional tests would add value?
- What risks would these tests mitigate?
- Estimated time investment?

**Option B: Proceed to Next Step**
- Why is current test coverage sufficient?
- What makes additional testing have diminishing returns?
- Are there any acceptable risks we're taking?

### 5. Recommendation
State clearly: Should we perform additional testing now or move forward? Justify your answer considering:
- Current project stage
- Complexity of recent changes
- Available time vs. quality improvement
- The fact that we'll test again after the next step

Remember: We aim for appropriate testing, not exhaustive testing. Balance quality assurance with development momentum. We don't want to hit the point of diminishing returns.


### 6. Next Steps
If you believe further testing is necessary commence testing now. 

If you do not believe further testing is necessary now then create a new git commit on the current branch. Leave no files unstaged or changes unstaged.
