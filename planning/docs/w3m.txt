For Your Use Case, Install W3M:
Perfect! W3M is now installed. Here's how your AI coding assistant (like Cursor) can use it for verification:

AI Verification Commands:

1. Basic Page Structure Check:
bash
2. Check Specific Elements:
bash
3. Accessibility Verification:
bash
4. Navigation Structure:
bash
What W3M Will Help AI Verify:

✅ HTML Structure - Proper nesting, semantic elements  
✅ Content Hierarchy - Headings, lists, sections in logical order  
✅ Link Text - Meaningful link descriptions  
✅ Form Elements - Input labels, form structure  
✅ Accessibility - Screen reader experience simulation  
✅ Content Flow - Reading order and logical progression  
✅ Table Structure - Data tables rendered properly  

Example AI Verification Workflow:

1. AI builds TypeScript/Tailwind site
2. Starts local dev server: deno serve --port 3000
3. Verifies with: w3m -dump http://localhost:3000
4. Checks accessibility: w3m -dump -o display_link_number=1 http://localhost:3000
5. AI can then verify:
•  Content is in logical reading order
•  Links have descriptive text
•  Headings create proper hierarchy
•  Forms are properly labeled

This is actually a really smart approach for AI-assisted development! The AI can catch structural and accessibility issues that visual inspection might miss.
