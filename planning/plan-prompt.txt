You are an expert full-stack software architect, technical project manager, and AI engineer.

Your task: **Given the Product Requirements Document (PRD) AND the answers to all clarifying questions provided below, produce a complete, actionable MVP-development plan that a junior developer—or an implementation-focused AI—can follow from zero to a working demo.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Inputs (inserted verbatim below this line)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PRD
# Product Requirements Document – WordWise AI (Marketing Manager Edition)

## 1-Sentence Product Summary
An AI-powered writing assistant that helps marketing managers craft high-converting, on-brand campaign copy in real time.

## 1. Goals & Non-Goals
### Goals
1. Deliver instant grammar, spelling, and style suggestions while the user types.
2. Provide brand-tone alignment and persuasive copy improvements tailored to marketing goals.
3. Offer analytics on suggestion adoption and copy performance to educate the marketer over time.
4. Support secure multi-device access to documents with realtime collaboration.

### Non-Goals
• Full Grammarly feature parity (e.g., plagiarism detection) in phase 1.  
• Deep collaboration features like Google Docs style commenting.  
• Offline-first mobile app (web-only MVP).

## 2. Target Audience
Primary persona: **Marketing Manager – B2B SaaS** (age 25-45) crafting website, email, and social campaign copy.  Writes 2-5 hours daily, values brand consistency and conversion metrics.

## 3. User Stories (MVP)
1. Tone Adjustment – "As a marketer, I want tone adjustments to match my brand voice across all content."
2. Persuasive Language – "As a marketer, I want persuasive language suggestions to improve conversion rates."
3. Conciseness – "As a marketer, I want conciseness improvements to create more impactful messaging."
4. Headline Optimization – "As a marketer, I want headline/title optimization suggestions to maximize engagement."
5. Readability Guidance – "As a marketer, I want real-time readability scores so my copy is clear to my target audience."
6. Vocabulary Variation – "As a marketer, I want vocabulary variation suggestions to avoid repetitive wording."
7. A/B Phrase Alternatives – "As a marketer, I want AI-generated A/B phrasing alternatives for key CTAs."

## 4. Success Metrics
• ≥ 85 % grammar-correction accuracy.  
• ≤ 1.5 s median latency for suggestions.  
• ≥ 80 % of AI suggestions accepted or modified (indicates relevance).  
• ≥ 10 % lift in click-through rate on copy using A/B suggestions (measured via marketer feedback surveys).

## 5. Functional Requirements
FR-1 Document Editor with rich-text input, highlighting, and inline suggestion cards.  
FR-2 Authentication (Supabase Auth).  
FR-3 Realtime grammar/style analysis via Edge Function calling OpenAI GPT-4o.  
FR-4 Brand-voice settings screen (tone, reading level, banned words list).  
FR-5 Analytics dashboard showing suggestion acceptance % and readability trend.  
FR-6 Storage of documents, suggestions, and user prefs in Postgres.  
FR-7 Export/share as Markdown or HTML.
FR-DEV_ONLY_1 test user button on login page for testing (to minimize developer keystrokes while testing)

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
NFR-1 99.5 % uptime.  


## 7. Technical Architecture
Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Zustand.  
Backend: Supabase (Postgres, Realtime), Edge Functions (Deno) for OpenAI calls.  
AI: OpenAI GPT-4o; future pgvector embeddings for semantic search.  
Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend).  

## 8. Data Model
• users(id, email, brand_tone,…).  
• documents(id, user_id, title, content, created_at).  
• suggestions(id, doc_id, start_idx, end_idx, type, original_text, suggestion_text, explanation, confidence).  
• analytics(id, user_id, metric, value, ts).

## 9. Timeline (7-day hack)
Day 1 Scaffold repo, auth, editor skeleton.  
Day 2 Store/fetch documents, basic save.  
Day 3 Grammar & spelling Edge Function.  
Day 4 Tone + persuasiveness models; inline UI.  
Day 5 Headline & readability features; dashboard.  
Day 6 A/B suggestion generator; polish.  
Day 7 Testing, deploy, record demo video.

## 10. Risks & Mitigations
• OpenAI latency spikes → cache recent prompts; show "loading" skeleton UI.  


2. Clarification Answers
Business
1. Should the MVP support multiple brand-voice profiles per user or a single global profile?
-One to start. 
2. What specific tone/style guidelines (e.g., formal, friendly, industry jargon) define "on-brand" for initial evaluation?
-Default to friendly. Though that could change based on Brand Identity.

UX
3. Should inline suggestion cards appear automatically as the user types or only when a highlighted segment is clicked?
-Only when a highlighted segment is clicked 
4. Must the editor support importing existing files (e.g., .docx, .md) for editing in the MVP?
-The editor should support a uploading a text file or creating a new document
5. Which export formats are required beyond Markdown and HTML (if any)?
-Text

Technical
6. Will the MVP handle only English text, or must it support additional languages?
-English only. 
7. What is the maximum expected document size (characters/words) the system must handle without performance degradation?
-2000 words 
8. Are team or shared workspaces required, or is the MVP single-user per document?
-Single user per document. 
9. Which authentication methods should be enabled at launch (email/password, magic link, social OAuth providers)?
- Supabase built-in authentication. 
10. What per-user rate limit (calls/min) should be enforced on OpenAI Edge Function requests?
-None for now. 
11. Is version history or document rollback required for the MVP?
-No. 
Analytics & Metrics
12. How will a user's acceptance of a suggestion be detected—explicit "accept" clicks, manual edits matching the suggestion, or both?
- Except clicks
13. At what interval should analytics data refresh in the dashboard (real-time streaming vs. periodic batch)?
- Periodic Batch 
14. What sample size or timeframe is necessary to judge the ≥ 10 % CTR lift metric as statistically significant?
- Ignore that one for now. 

Timeline & Process
15. Are formal code reviews or QA gates expected during the 7-day hack that could impact the stated daily milestones?
- Code should be largely done on Friday, day 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

When building the plan, **strictly cover each numbered section**:

1. **Executive Summary**

• Keep language concise yet instructional; assume a junior developer audience.
• All items must be actionable and sequenced logically.
