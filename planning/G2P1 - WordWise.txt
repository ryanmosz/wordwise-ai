WordWise AI - partial Grammarly clone
Write with confidence. Edit with intelligence.
________________


Background

The AI Revolution: Modern large language models have fundamentally changed what's possible in writing assistance. Instead of rule-based corrections, AI can understand intent, context, and nuance. Rather than generic feedback, AI can provide personalized coaching that actually improves writing skills over time.
What if we could rebuild Grammarly from the ground up with today's AI capabilities? Instead of users struggling with robotic corrections, AI could provide intelligent, contextual guidance. Rather than reactive editing, AI could enhance the writing process itself—understanding goals, suggesting improvements, and teaching better communication.
Today, we're building the next generation of writing tools: AI-first assistants that don't just correct writing, but make people better writers.
