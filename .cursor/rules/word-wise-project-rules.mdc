# WordWise AI Project Rules

## Task Management

This project follows a detailed task list located at:
**`tasks/tasks-wordwise-opus.md`**

### CRITICAL: Read Docker Development Requirements

**BEFORE starting any development work, you MUST read the Docker development environment requirements at the top of `tasks/tasks-wordwise-opus.md`.** 

This section contains critical information about:
- Why Docker development is required for this project
- Correct development workflow using `docker-compose up`
- What NOT to do (local npm/vite commands)
- Environment variable handling in containers

### Task Completion Protocol

Follow the task completion protocol outlined in the process-task-list.mdc rule:
- Complete ONE sub-task at a time
- Wait for user permission before proceeding to next sub-task
- Mark completed tasks with `[x]` in the task list
- Update the "Relevant Files" section as you work

### Project Context

WordWise AI is a marketing copy assistant with:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Supabase backend (auth, database, edge functions)
- TipTap rich text editor
- AI-powered suggestions for copywriting
- Containerized development environment

### Development Environment Verification

Always verify the Docker environment is running before starting work:
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Should show frontend and postgres containers running
```

Access the application at: http://localhost:3000/ (served from Docker container)

**Failure to follow the Docker development requirements has repeatedly caused environment issues. Always prioritize containerized development over local machine development.**
