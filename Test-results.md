# Test Results

## Testing Methodology
- Document all test results in this single file
- Only mention tests that fail (passing tests are assumed successful)
- Include screenshots when relevant
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next task
- Use checkbox format [] for easy marking with x

## Previous Test Results

### Initial UI Testing
- [x] **1.b** The page looks good, colors wise, but I don't really see a gradient. See the uploaded screenshot.
- [x] **2.c** Everything is working correctly and the buttons do darken on hover. However because the shade is so close you have to look really close to see it. Maybe there is a different or better way to call attention to the hover.
- [x] **2.d** The bottom border looks like a white background with gray characters, if that's what you mean. Once again, you can check on the screenshot.
- [x] **3.c** Once again I see a white background but I guess if by border you mean thin gray line, then yes I see that as well. You can verify in the screenshot.
- [x] **3.d** Clicking the document title does nothing. When the page loads, there's a downward-facing carrot, and whenever you click on it, it stays exactly the same as you can see in the screenshot.
- [x] **4.a/b** I would say the proportions look more like four-fifths and one-fifth to me respectively but it looks good I'm happy with it.
- [x] **5.c/d** It's definitely not edge to edge. It may be centered, but because I can only see a few words, I can't tell you for sure that it is centered. There is padding. It looks good. I could tell better if there was more text.
- [x] **9.a** Text does darken but as I said earlier, it's such a slight effect because of the closeness of the shades. Maybe there's something else we could do with that. Perhaps we need to add another color but is there another way other than a different color?

## Task 5.5 - Auto-save Testing Results

### Final Status: âœ… PASSED

**Issues Found and Fixed:**
- [x] Authentication wasn't persisting on refresh (fixed with auth state listener)
- [x] Documents weren't loading after refresh (fixed with proper initialization)
- [x] Intermittent loading issues (fixed with initialization flag)

**Current Behavior:**
- [x] Auto-save works with 2-second debounce
- [x] Content persists across refreshes
- [x] Authentication persists across refreshes
- [x] Document loads in ~1 second after refresh
- [x] No duplicate empty documents created

**Performance Optimizations Added:**
- [x] Limited document loading to 20 most recent
- [x] Reuse empty documents instead of creating duplicates
- [x] Added cleanup method for empty documents
